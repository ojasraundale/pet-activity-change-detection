# Objective

This project focuses on building classifiers that accurately identify the activities being performed by individuals using their smartphone sensor data. Using this, we aim to quickly detect the change in the activity of the subject with the best possible accuracy. In this work, we present a comparative study wherein we compare the performances of machine learning algorithms namely k-Means and Hidden Markov Models with the modern Deep Learning algorithm Long Short Term Memory Networks (LSTM).

## About
This was a group course project for the course Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning taught by Prof. Mahadev Prasanna. Our team name was SOJA - an acronym for the teammates: Siddharta Soma, Ojas Raundale, Jay Garchar, and Ameya Vadnere.
